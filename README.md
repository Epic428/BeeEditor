### Resourceful Bees Bee Editor

This project is created using Spring and will serve as the Backend and eventually the Frontend for the web-based Bee Editor. Contributions to the project are welcome.

#### Planned Features

- Security and User Logins
- AWS/DB backup
- Ability to browse all public bee creations and mix/match to generate a zip file containing the relevant files.
- Add hooks to the mod to pull Bees from the server via Bee ID
- And probably more I haven't thought of
